# 🧠 ML Journey from DBA: Sudarsan's Transition to Machine Learning 🚀

> *"Journeys are meant for the brave."*

Hi, I'm **Sudarsan Rajagopalan**, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate (2011–2015) from Rajalakshmi Engineering College, affiliated with **Anna University**. I ranked **38th out of over 19,000 students** in the Anna University final results — a milestone that reflects my commitment to excellence and deep learning.

Welcome! With nearly a decade of experience as a Mainframe DB2 DBA, I’m now transitioning fully into the world of **Machine Learning Engineering**. This repository serves as a living record of my transformation — documenting everything from foundational skills to real-world ML projects.

## 🎯 Goal

To become an industry-ready Machine Learning Engineer within one year — by learning, practicing, and building real-world projects from the ground up.

## 🗺️ Journey Roadmap

### 🔄 Phase 1: Foundations
- [X] Python programming (functions, OOP, data structures)
- [ ] NumPy & Pandas (data handling)
- [ ] Data visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
- [ ] Math for ML (linear algebra, probability, statistics)

### 🔜 Phase 2: Core Machine Learning
- [ ] Scikit-learn models (regression, classification, clustering)
- [ ] Model evaluation & metrics
- [ ] Feature engineering & preprocessing
- [ ] Small ML projects (Kaggle, public datasets)

### 🔜 Phase 3: Advanced ML & Deployment
- [ ] XGBoost, ensemble learning
- [ ] Model deployment (Flask, FastAPI)
- [ ] Real-world end-to-end ML pipelines

## 🚀 My Machine Learning Journey

### 🧠 Phase 1: Python Basics – ✅ Completed

I've completed the foundational Python lessons using Kaggle's excellent "Python" micro-course.  
Each notebook is versioned and documented in this repo under `01_python_basics/`.

### 📚 Completed Notebooks:

| No.| Notebook Filename | Description |
|----|-------------------|-------------|
| 01 | `01_hello_python.ipynb` | Intro to Python syntax, expressions |
| 02 | `02_functions_help.ipynb` | Functions, `help()`, and documentation |
| 03 | `03_booleans_conditionals.ipynb` | Booleans, conditionals, `if`, `else` |
| 04 | `04_lists.ipynb` | Lists, indexing, slicing |
| 05 | `05_loops.ipynb` | For-loops, while-loops, iteration |
| 06 | `06_strings_and_dictionaries.ipynb` | String manipulation, dictionaries |
| 07 | `07_working_with_external_libraries.ipynb` | Using external libraries (`math`, `random`, etc.) |

### ✅ Summary:
> **Phase 1 is complete**. This forms my solid Python foundation to now move into **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and eventually **machine learning** workflows.

Next: Phase 2 – `02_numpy_pandas/` → coming soon.
